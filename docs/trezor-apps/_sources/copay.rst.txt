TREZOR User Manual

Using Copay wallet and TREZOR together
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On your PC, Copay can be used with TREZOR as an alternative to TREZOR Wallet. After you import one of your TREZOR accounts into Copay,
you will be able to check its balance, transaction history and send payments from it. More profoundly, Copay is one the first bitcoin apps, that lets
you create shared (or multi-signature) wallet. Below, we provide an example how three company owners can create and manage a shared wallet.


Creating 2-of-3 shared wallet
-----------------------------

Imagine that Alice, Bob and Charlie are managing company bitcoin funds together. For this purpose they will create 2-of-3 shared wallet where transactions has to be signed by two of them. Thus when Alice creates and signs transaction proposal, she needs Bob or Charlie to cooperate and sign her proposal to make a transaction on behalf of the company.

Alice initiates shared wallet creation in Copay using her TREZOR and then she shares invitation with Bob and Charlie, so that can join the wallet using their TREZORs.

From application menu in Copay, she selects **Add Wallet** > **Create New Wallet**. After filling out her name and wallet parameters on the **Shared Wallet** tab, she selects TREZOR Hardware Wallet from Wallet Seed menu and enters an unused shared TREZOR account.

.. important:: Shared accounts (which use 48 as the `BIP43 <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0043.mediawiki>`_ "Purpose field") are different from your personal accounts (BIP44) and can't be viewed in TREZOR Wallet. User must choose a unique shared account number that is not already used in other shared wallet. If selected account is not unique, Copay will notify user.

When Alice confirms to **Create 2-of-3 Wallet**, TREZOR Connect dialog will appear and let Alice to connect her TREZOR, authenticate with PIN, check and confirm the action. After exporting two account public keys, Copay will display **wallet invitation**, secret that will Alice share with their colleagues.

To join the created wallet, Bob and Charlie have to launch their Copay app and select **Add Wallet** > **Join Shared Wallet**, paste the wallet invitation. Since they want to join using their TREZORs, they will select TREZOR Hardware Wallet from Wallet Seed menu and enter an unused shared TREZOR account in the similar way as Alice and hit **Join**. After everybody joins, all copayers will be able to see a new wallet in their Copay app.

Receiving payment in shared wallet
----------------------------------

Receiving payments in shared wallet is similar as with personal wallet. Each copayer can generate an unused receiving address in the Receive tab. Received payments are displayed in the History tab.

Note that Alice doesn't have to worry about coordination of her receiving address with Bob and Charlie because unique address is displayed for each copayer all the time.

Sending payment from shared wallet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sending payment from shared wallet requires cooperation of other copayers. When Alice decides to send company bitcoins, she goes to Send tab, enters recipient address and amount. When she confirms to Send the transactions, TREZOR Connect dialog will appear and let Alice to connect her TREZOR, authenticate with PIN, check and confirm the transaction on TREZOR's display.

After Alice signs the transaction, a payment proposal is created and Bob and Charlie are notified about it. When Bob opens his Copay, he will see the payment proposal in the Home tab. He can go on and check the details. When he decides to Accept the proposal, he will sign it in the same way as Alice, which (in case of 2-of-3 wallet) will finalize the payment proposal and transaction will be published.

Meanwhile Alice can monitor the state of her payment proposal. When the transaction is finalized she will see "Payment sent" confirmation. Alice, Bob and Charlie can always check all the transactions later in History tab.
